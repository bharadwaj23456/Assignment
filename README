# Carousel and Search Bar iOS App

This iOS app demonstrates the use of a carousel view combined with a sticky search bar that pins to the top of the screen when scrolled. The app is built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM architecture.

## Features

- **Carousel View**: A scrollable, page-based carousel that displays images.
- **Sticky Search Bar**: A search bar initially placed below the carousel that pins to the top of the screen when scrolled.
- **Dynamic List**: A list of items that updates based on the search query entered in the search bar.
